## Custom Domain Setup

If you want `youtubewrapped.yourdomain.com`:

1. In Netlify dashboard:
   - Go to "Domain settings"
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter your domain

2. Update DNS records:
   ```
   CNAME youtubewrapped your-site.netlify.app
   ```

3. Wait for DNS propagation (up to 24 hours)

## Environment Variables

None needed! Everything runs client-side.

## Build Settings

```toml
[build]
  publish = "public"
  command = "echo 'No build needed'"
```

Already configured in `netlify.toml`.
